I am a PhD student in informatics with a primary focus on understanding privacy perceptions and designing user-centered privacy interfaces.

`Privacy Communications and User Interfaces`: I explore how these factors influence user decisions related to data sharing on online platforms. I aim to provide users with better-informed choices to respect user privacy and maximize the data power of products, particularly in the context of evolving data-centric systems and privacy regulations.
