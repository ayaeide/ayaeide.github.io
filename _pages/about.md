I am a PhD candidate in informatics at Pennsylvania State University's College of Information Sciences and Technology. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr.Tanusree Sharma](https://tanusreesharma.github.io/). My current research interests are usable security and privacy for Web3/Decentralized Internet.

`Privacy Communications and User Interfaces`: I explore how these factors influence user decisions related to data sharing on online platforms. I aim to provide users with better-informed choices to respect user privacy and maximize the data power of products, particularly in the context of evolving data-centric systems and privacy regulations.
