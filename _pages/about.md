I am a PhD candidate in informatics at Pennsylvania State University's College of Information Sciences and Technology. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr.Tanusree Sharma](https://tanusreesharma.github.io/). My current research interests are usable security and privacy for Web3/Decentralized Internet.

`Platform Transparency`: With my industry experience, Iâ€™ve observed significant challenges in the transparency of data-sharing practices. I am passionate about designing transparent interfaces that foster trust and accountability for building fair and ethical online platforms.

`Decentralized Internet`: My interest in decentralized systems arises from a desire to explore structures that empower users and reduce platform dominance. These systems align with my broader goal of promoting user autonomy by minimizing the influence of centralized entities.
